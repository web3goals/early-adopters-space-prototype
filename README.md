## ‚ú® Description

Early Adopters Space is a web3 application where you can publish your early stage project and activites for early adopters that will be useful for the growth of your project.

For each completed activity, early adopters will receive mystery boxes, which you will only reveal once the project is launched and successful. This way users will be more motivated in your success because their future reward depends on it.

You have several types of activity to choose from. It can be a task to send a feedback, follow you on social media, try a demo, invite friends, etc.

Some activities will be checked using smart contracts and oracles. Others will need to be checked by yourself.

Also, a user who has completed the activity gets an opportunity to send a message to the project chat. Here he can communicate with the project founders, offer his ideas or send found bugs.

## üî® How it's made

To create this project, I used:

- Filecoin, Scroll and Mantle for storing smart contracts to create social profiles and projects, verify user activities and distribute rewards.

- Push Protocol to provide a private group chat for each project that is only open to early adopters with completed activities.

- UMA as an oracle to verify that off-chain activity is really completed.

- Web3.Storage for storing metadata of social profiles and projects.

- Tableland as a storage of completed activities that people can publish without paying for transactions.
